## Fundamentals of NestJS

NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It leverages TypeScript by default and is heavily inspired by Angular's architecture.

### Key Concepts

- **Modules**: The basic building blocks of a NestJS application. Modules help organize code into cohesive blocks of functionality.
- **Controllers**: Handle incoming HTTP requests and return responses to the client.
- **Providers**: Services or classes that can be injected as dependencies. Used for business logic, database access, etc.
- **Dependency Injection**: NestJS uses a powerful dependency injection system to manage class dependencies.
- **Middleware**: Functions executed before the route handler, useful for logging, authentication, etc.
- **Pipes**: Used for input validation and data transformation.
- **Guards**: Implement authorization logic to protect routes.
- **Interceptors**: Add extra logic before/after method execution, such as logging or transforming results.
- **Decorators**: Annotations that add metadata to classes and methods, enabling features like routing and dependency injection.

### Getting Started

1. **Installation**:

   ```bash
   npm i -g @nestjs/cli
   nest new project-name
   ```

2. **Project Structure**:

   ```
   src/
     app.module.ts
     app.controller.ts
     app.service.ts
   ```

3. **Running the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
